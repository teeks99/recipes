Basic English Toffee
====================

Use a sauce pan with a heavy base, important that the heat gets spread out.

1.  Heat 1lb (4 sticks) of butter to melting
2.  Add 2 cups granulated sugar
3.  Add a pinch of salt
4.  Heat to boiling (sugar dissolved), stiring constantly
5.  Over medium heat, slowly (ideally 20+ minutes) raise the temperature to 285, as measured with a candy thermometer. 
    *   Stir occasionally, once every few minutes, but towards the end try not to scrape the bottom. Leave any burnt 
        particles on the bottom.
6.  Pour into 11x16 pan covered in parchment paper. Do not scrape the sauce pan, leave burned parts there.
7.  After the toffee cools for a couple minutes, cover in chocolate chips (dark, semi-sweet, or milk) about 1.5c to 
    cover.
8.  Once chips have melted, spread to a even layer.


Note: 1lb/2c sugar gives a think toffee in a 11x16 pan. Try 3/4 recipe.
